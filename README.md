# dynamicwindowmanager
By default dwm is a barebones window manager and it's meant to be that way! Minimalism is at the core of suckless's philosophy. I am a heavy desktop user and to use dwm as my window manager I needed some tweaking and tinkering done. This is pretty much adapted to my particular workflow and I have 'patched' some components to the default build.
